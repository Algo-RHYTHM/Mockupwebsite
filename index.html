      <h1 class="fontColor">OUR STORY</h1>
      <p>Girgitle is the only ultimate players team in Mysureu. At a time when Ultimate was gaining popularity in metropolitan cities like Bengaluru, Chennai and Mumbai, it was still a game that was unheard of here in Mysuru. There were people playing the Frisbee, but only as a time-pass.

        Prajwal, a student of Mechanical Engineering at NIE College and a tri-athlete, was riding his cycle with a few of his friends. It was a regular affair for Prajwal and his friends to unwind by playing the Frisbee during their rides. He says, “It was in one of these rides that we decided to have a team of our own – the first one in Mysuru. Santosh, who is part of Bengaluru’s Ultimate team Disc-O-Dewane encouraged us to form a team and told us that he and his team would help them with the required training. Incidentally, Disc-O-Dewane has a lot of people who studied at NIE, so they were also excited about having an Ultimate team from Mysuru. With Santosh as our mentor, we were ready to have our own team.”
        
        When asked about the name of the team – “Girgitle,” Pragna, Prajwal’s younger sister studying II PU at Sadvidya, who is also a part of the team, said, “The name was very accidental. We were looking for a name that would be unique and different and yet have that ‘Mysuru touch’ to it and Sandeep, our team mate suggested ‘Girgitle’ and we all agreed to it instantly.” </p>

  <div id="about">
    <div class="fontColor">ABOUT</div>
    <p>Girgitle participated in its first official Ultimate tournament — The Bangalore Ultimate Open 2015 at Jain International Residential School on Kanakapura Road, Bengaluru, held between June 26 and 28.

      After topping Group F that had teams like Blitz Legacy, Slip Disc, Disc Qualified and Teen Guna Lagaan, Girgitle finished 4th in the bronze pool after losing against Chakra in a relegation match. Girgitle are now seeded at 20 out of the 31 teams that took part in the tournament. For a team participating for the first time in an official tournament, Girgitle’s performance is both an achievement, an encouragement and a proud moment for Mysuru..</p>
